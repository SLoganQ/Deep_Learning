# Deep_Learning
Advanced Python

This is an attempt to recreate the coding exercise found at https://github.com/josephlee94/intuitive-deep-learning, written by Joseph Lee Wei En.

Unfortunately, I was unable to successfully run these programs because keras was misbehaving; the output traceback calls were included as comments at the end of the programs.
